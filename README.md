elektropaintjs
==============

This is a version of the IRIX screensaver "Electropaint". Electropaint was a trippy screensaver that came with IRIX. There's a great history of it here: [](http://darkside.cometway.com/content.agent?page_name=Article&name=001). During my time at SGI I rewrote Electropaint to use OpenGL instead of IrisGL and it wasn't quite the same afterwards (I removed the control UI since the panels toolkit wasn't making the journey and I must have broken the random seed...). As pennance for that, I took an hour to do a JavaScript implementation. It works on WebKit-based browsers that support 3D layer compositing.
